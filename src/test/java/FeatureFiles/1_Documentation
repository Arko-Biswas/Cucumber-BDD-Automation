Two types of REg Expressions in Cucumber:

1. Regular Expression --> [0-9]+, (Ild+)
2. Cucumber Expression (2017)

 rules:
1. Step def file will be generating cucumber exp by default
2. But you can use regular exp also in step def file
3. You can mix both regular and cucumber exp in step definition file
4. but you can not mix both expressions in a step definition method

 {string} {int} {float}-- cucumber expression

 Regular Expressions:| I

 ([0-9]) ->capture group --> 0 to 9 digits appear
 
 Quantifiers in RegExp: + * ? {n}
 Quantifiers: how many times a character needs to be occurred
 
 ([0-9]+) -> 0 to 9 digits appear (once or more)
 ([0-9]{4}) --> 0000, 9999, 1212, 3456, 1234, 8888 ==> between 0-9, generate 4 digits number
 ([0-9]*) -> zero or more ==> generate 0 or AT LEAST once
 ([0-9]?) -> zero or once ==> generate 0 or AT MOST once

Short hand character:

 \d -- numeric digits
 (\d+)
 
 e.g. :
 ([a-zA-Z0-9]+) ==> generate a character between a-z,A-z, 0-9 more than once
